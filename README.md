# AI Code Snippet Generator

## About
This app started as a 4 hour hackathon between my friends and I to build and NextJs app for generating code snippets. 
The app you are looking at now is a refined version of that app. It is essentially an interface between the user and OpenAI that makes generating code snippets easier for any number of languages. The coolest part about this app is that once I got the interface running, I was able to use it to build additional features. 

## Getting Started

Add your openAi API Token to a file called apiToken in the app directory
```src/app/apiToken.js```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
